        "This project aims to analyze obesity trends in the United States across different states, age groups, and race/ethnicity categories, using two datasets related to nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. Our focus is on comparing the trends in obesity rates between two distinct age groups: Group 1 (children aged 3 months to 4 years) and Group 2 (adults aged 20 years to 75+ years). The analysis will uncover patterns in obesity trends over the years, identify states that have shown significant improvement or worsening trends, and explore whether certain race/ethnicity groups have experienced notable changes in weight categories (normal weight, overweight, and obesity).\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, we will examine correlations between childhood obesity (Group 1) and adult obesity (Group 2) within the same states to determine if a connection exists between obesity rates in children and adults. Furthermore, we will investigate regional differences by comparing obesity rates between southern and northern states for both children and adults, segmented by race/ethnicity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project will involve data wrangling, exploratory analysis, data visualization, and the application of statistical models to answer the key questions. Ultimately, our goal is to provide data-driven insights into the factors driving obesity trends and to offer policy recommendations for targeting at-risk states and demographic groups."
